Somehow landed on rentersden.com and saw their mobile app. Gave me the heeby jeebeez (whatever that is lol), gave it 20mins of hacking together on jQuery Mobile for a clickable mock prototype, which could probably be used by their developers as a boilerplate.

* index.html = main landing page
* search.html = search bar with adjustable range ?
* location.html = landing page for users region (this should probably first page)


*Warning: did not test on android or blackberry*
